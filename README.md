▶ Overview

A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children referred to as left child and right child. This implementation supports basic operations and provides various traversal methods.  

▶ Features

* **Insertion**: Add nodes to the binary tree.  
* **Traversal**: Supports pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversals.
* **Searching**: Find a specific value in the tree.  
* **Deletion**: Remove nodes and clear the tree.  
* **Height and Size Calculation**: Retrieve the height and size of the tree.
